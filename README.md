# VDPS
The Voice Direction Processing System was a response to a proposal by Dr Steven Knudsen to create a
system capable of detecting voices within a 4x4 m
2 enclosed room [3]. This system was required to be
based on the Raspberry Pi microcomputer system, detect and localize sound, and provide this to the user
via an API and web application. This type of system is useful for home automation companies, and can
be used to enhance speaker intelligibility, in addition to assisting in other IoT related roles.

GCC-PHAT was the selected algorithm that was leveraged to localize incoming sound, and the ReSpeaker
4 Microphone Array System was used to triangulate the incoming sound sources. GCC-PHAT is based on
conventional cross-correlation algorithms used to localize sound, and suited this project adequately [4].
VDPS is based on a two block system composed of a hardware unit functioning as the sound recording
and processing center, and purely software backend designed to store recordings and provide simple
data visualization. The frontend unit is composed of the Raspberry Pi and the Respeaker, and connects to
a hosted web application.

This solution offers superior scalability and is advantageous for the end user as it provides a simple
setup, and user friendly interface. One of the major goals of VDPS is to be as elegant and simple to the
user as possible, while retaining as much insight as possible from the collected data. Furthermore,
accuracy is of the utmost importance to VDPS, which is achieved via the GCC-PHAT Algorithm.
